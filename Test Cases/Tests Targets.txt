1- in test#3 ---> you did not match the following note
NOTE: The input lines of all events are sorted by the event day in ascending order. --> in the doc. page # 6
Read   [*]
Solved [*]

2- in test#8 ----> you gave an identical IDs for more than one mission (the last 3 events)
i do not know should the program fix such a case or not ---> it is easy to fix i think
Read   [*]
Solved [*]
Note: They are typos generated because I was copy the events and change in them.

3- in test#7 ---> there is no events ---> so in Rufaida part there was a division by zero in the function <CollectStatistics_File>
i have already fixed it 
thanks Alaa for putting such a case

Response: I hope you was thanking me not cursing me! XD

1- read #2 in Alaa section above  --> should we fix such a case or not

2- conflict in my mind ---> why when we store the itemCount of any list in a var < count > 
then during debugging they take different values ----> i have changd it and use the getItemCount directly and the error is fixed then
but what is the reason for that ????  -----> tell me to send you the photo if you do not get the idea i am talking about

3- there are some cases still do not work

4- one confusing case ---> the days does not stop ---> but the problem is fixed when just i reduce the MLOC of some mission  --> How ??
---> ask me for a photo !

5- promotion event can not be on a formulated mission that formulated in a day after the promotion event day ---> should we fix it --> i do not think

------------------
read # 3 in Alaa section   ---> i think more modification is needed in the output file ---> because AutoP will be zero but it should be undefined






Is it allowed to make the return of all getters in the MarsStatoin by ref ----> i do not think so as they said in the doc that before any friedship,
we have to ask the TAs
and when we make the return type by ref we have the ability to modify the data member like setters and this is like the friendship
for ex ---> in class UI
