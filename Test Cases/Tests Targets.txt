1- in test#3 ---> you did not match the following note
NOTE: The input lines of all events are sorted by the event day in ascending order. --> in the doc. page # 6
Read   [*]
Solved [*]

2- in test#8 ----> you gave an identical IDs for more than one mission (the last 3 events)
i do not know should the program fix such a case or not ---> it is easy to fix i think
Read   [*]
Solved [*]
Note: They are typos generated because I was copy the events and change in them.

3- in test#7 ---> there is no events ---> so in Rufaida part there was a division by zero in the function <CollectStatistics_File>
i have already fixed it 
thanks Alaa for putting such a case

read # 3 in Alaa section   ---> i think more modification is needed in the output file ---> because AutoP will be zero but it should be undefined






Is it allowed to make the return of all getters in the MarsStatoin by ref ----> i do not think so as they said in the doc that before any friedship,
we have to ask the TAs
and when we make the return type by ref we have the ability to modify the data member like setters and this is like the friendship
for ex ---> in class UI
